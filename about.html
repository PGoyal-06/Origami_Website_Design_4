<h3>
7 stunning benefits of making Origami    
</h3>
<p>
<h5>
1. Mathematical Skills Development
</h5>
Considering its vital advantages, the Japanese have made origami a part of the elementary school curriculum. Broadly speaking, this art develops:
<br/>
<h5>
Spatial skills
<br/>
Thinking skills
<br/>
Analytical skills
<br/>
Creative skills
<br/> 
Behavioural skills
<br/>
Motor skills
</h5>
<br/>
<h5>
2. Building Cognitive Abilities
</h5> 
Origami is an art that involves both cognitive and motor skills. 
Research shows that the simple folds of paper help enhance superimposition and refine adjustment strategies in children. 
Consequently, their hand-eye coordination improves and their perceptual skills are also strengthened. 
With greater perceptual skills, the ability to assess and recognize patterns drastically upgrades. 
This makes students quick to grasp, assess, and act on any given information. 
In general, focus, retention, concentration, and cognitive skills can be developed in kids through easy origami patterns. 
<br/> 
<h5>
3. Develops a Problem-Solving Attitude
</h5>
Origami is the answer to many questions in the field of physics, mathematics, and astronomy. 
It helps in the development of scientific theories and is a massive hit among researchers and scientists. 
Each fold of paper called a crease, uses cognition and creativity, simultaneously. 
In fact, scientists shape their own origami models as a problem-solving exercise.
<br/>
<h5>
4. Boosts Creativity
</h5>
By folding a paper crease after crease, you eagerly anticipate the end result. 
It can be a plane, a flower, a rabbit, or even an elephant: there are n number of possibilities with origami. 
When children manipulate paper with their own hands, they unleash their creative powers. 
Higher-order thinking skills work together with imagination to put together the most aesthetic piece of creation, all from a single sheet of paper. 
It becomes a reflection of individuality.
<br/>
<h5>
5. Promotes Social Skills
</h5>
Origami is a powerful tool to build necessary social skills among kids. 
Here children and adults come together to learn and create something original. 
Schools use origami to teach the value of teamwork and cooperative learning. 
As a group project, origami stimulates interaction, builds connections, and strengthens conversational skills. 
<br/>
<h5>
6. Aids General Wellness
</h5>
Being an extremely mindful and creative skill origami has therapeutic benefits apart from educational ones.
It promotes general wellness by attributing a sense of achievement and satisfaction in a person. 
This is the same satisfaction that creators relish when they make things out of thin air. 
<br/>
<h5>
7. Science Made Easy
</h5>
Science and mathematics are basic subjects that make up a school curriculum. 
But more often students find them boring and lifeless. 
But now, teachers have introduced origami for a change. Origami helps students to simplify the concepts of physics by understanding 3D comprehension and theories. 
This way, origami promotes originality by giving students a blank sheet to experiment and design. 
Origami, used by scientists like Kaushik Jayaram and researchers like Robert Lang has added to this skill's success and relevance.
